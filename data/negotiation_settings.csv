766_6152088122,electronics,Samsung PN51F8500 51-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Smart Plasma HDTV,"Up for sale is my 51"" Samsung PN51F8500: The last and best remaining plasma TV you can buy. It's been discontinued by Samsung, so buying it used it the only route to go. I have owned this TV for about 6 months now. It is in prestine condition (still has the plastic cling wrap around the bezels because I never remove those). It has consistently been considered the best TV picture out there for 2 years in a row. The black levels/viewing angles/etc all blow away even 4k HDTVs that cost way more. Read up for yourself. You won't be able to buy a plasma, just LCDs or the exponentially more pricey OLED. Come with TV, remote, and a pair of 3D glasses.",1200,1080,Smart Plasma TV
